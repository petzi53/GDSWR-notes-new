The {**cowplot**} package provides various features that help with creating publication-quality figures, such as a set of themes, functions to align plots and arrange them into complex compound figures, and functions that make it easy to annotate plots and or mix plots with images. The package was originally written for internal use in the Wilke lab, hence the name (Claus O. Wilke’s plot package). It has also been used extensively in the book [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492031089).
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several packages that can be used to align plots. The most widely used ones beside {**cowplot**} are {**egg**} and {**patchwork**} (see @sec-patchwork). All these packages use slightly different approaches to plot alignment, and the respective approaches have different strengths and weaknesses. If you cannot achieve your desired result with one of these packages try another one.

Most importantly, while {**egg**} and {**patchwork**} align and arrange plots at the same time, {**cowplot**} aligns plots independently of how they are arranged. This makes it possible to align plots and then reproduce them separately, or even overlay them on top of each other.

The {**cowplot**} package now provides a set of complementary themes with different features. I now believe that there isn’t one single theme that works for all figures, and therefore I recommend that you always explicitly set a theme for every plot you make.

::: {layout="[10, 30]" layout-valign="center"}
![](img/logoi/logo-dplyr-min.png){width="176"}

{**dplyr**} is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges: - mutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables - select() picks variables based on their names. - filter() picks cases based on their values. - summarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary. - arrange() changes the ordering of the rows.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation “by group”. You can learn more about them in [vignette("dplyr")](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html). As well as these single-table verbs, dplyr also provides a variety of two-table verbs, which you can learn about in [vignette("two-table")](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html).

![](img/logoi/logo-ggplot2-min.png){width="176"}

{**ggplot2**} is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on [The Grammar of Graphics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0). You provide the data, tell {**ggplot2**} how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details. [@ggplot2]
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s hard to succinctly describe how {**ggplot2**} works because it embodies a deep philosophy of visualization. However, in most cases you start with `ggplot()`, supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with `aes()`). You then add on layers (like `geom_point()` or `geom_histogram()`), scales (like `scale_colour_brewer()`), faceting specifications (like `facet_wrap()`) and coordinate systems (like `coord_flip()`).

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a lot of necessary jargon to learn for working with geospatial data. The goal of this glossary is to provide a lightweight solution for making glossaries in educational materials written in quarto or R Markdown. This package provides functions to link terms in text to their definitions in an external glossary file, as well as create a glossary table of all linked terms at the end of a section.

Glue offers interpreted string literals that are small, fast, and dependency-free. Glue does this by embedding R expressions in curly braces which are then evaluated and inserted into the argument string.

<center>[Miscellaneous Functions for "Grid" Graphics](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gridExtra) [@gridExtra]</center>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<center>(*There is no hexagon sticker available for {**gridExtra**}.*)</center>

Provides a number of user-level functions to work with "grid" graphics, notably to arrange multiple grid-based plots on a page, and draw tables.

The {**grid**) package (= part of the R system library) provides low-level functions to create graphical objects (`grobs`), and position them on a page in specific viewports. The {**gtable**} package introduced a higher-level layout scheme, arguably more amenable to user-level interaction. With the `gridExtra::arrangeGrob()` / `gridExtra::grid.arrange()` pair of functions, {**gridExtra**} builds upon {**gtable**} to arrange multiple `grobs` on a page.

Tools to make it easier to work with "tables" of 'grobs'. The 'gtable' package defines a 'gtable' grob class that specifies a grid along with a list of grobs and their placement in the grid. Further the package makes it easy to manipulate and combine 'gtable' objects so that complex compositions can be built up sequentially.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {layout="[10, 30]" layout-valign="center"}
![](img/logoi/logo-patchwork-min.png){width="176"}

The goal of {**patchwork**} is to make it ridiculously simple to combine separate `ggplots` into the same graphic. As such it tries to solve the same problem as `gridExtra::grid.arrange()` and `cowplot::plot_grid` but using an `r glossary("APIx", "API")` that incites exploration and iteration, and scales to arbitrarily complex layouts.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The {**ggplot2**} package provides a strong API for sequentially building up a plot, but does not concern itself with composition of multiple plots. {**patchwork**} is a package that expands the API to allow for arbitrarily complex composition of plots by, among others, providing mathematical operators for combining multiple plots. Other packages that try to address this need (but with a different approach) are {**gridExtra**} and {**cowplot**} (see @sec-gridExtra and @sec-cowplot).

Before plots can be laid out, they have to be assembled. Arguably one of patchwork’s biggest selling points is that it expands on the use of `+` in ggplot2 to allow plots to be added together and composed, creating a natural extension of the {**ggplot2**} API.

While quite complex compositions can be achieved using `+`, `|`, and `/`, it may be necessary to take even more control over the layout. All of this can be controlled using the `patchwork::plot_layout()` function along with a couple of special placeholder objects.
